Rather than build this capacity themselves, both states delegated it to private investors, granting them sovereign powers, including the right to wage war, sign treaties, and administer territory, in exchange for commercial returns.",

However, in both cases, reassertion only became politically executable once the firms had collapsed under their own contradictions. The VOC was bankrupted by corruption and overextension across too many Asian trade routes, while the EIC was destabilised by the Mutiny, which exposed how thoroughly the Company had mismanaged Indian governance and how little legitimacy its private administration commanded among its governed populace. Thus, nationalisation was less a governance choice than a last resort of the state.",

The firm cultivated a direct relationship with Wilhelm II, King of Prussia, supplying artillery that outperformed anything state arsenals could produce. This led the state-firm relationship to a mutual capture, as the Prussian military could not declare war without Krupp's backing, but Krupp could not survive without state contracts.

For the first two decades of Standard Oil's dominance, the federal government largely left it alone, as abundant oil was serving the US industrial expansion and there was no pressing strategic reason to intervene. The security dimension became explicit in the 1890s as oil became essential to modernising naval and military competencies, and the US government realised it was strategically dependent on a single private firm for fuel supply.",
